# Mentawai Surf Predictor

**Aim:** to build a basic Python script to give suggestions as to which surf spot to go, based on the current conditions.

**Surf spots (output variables):** Seven Palms, Scarecrows, Telescopes, Outers, Middles, Backyards, Hookers, G4, Icelands and Tikus. 

**Conditions (input variables):** Date and time, Tide (moon phase, high/low tide), Swell (period, height and direction in degrees), Wind (speed and direction).

**Ideas/things to research:**
API for tides and moonphases? 
Historical data on surf conditions?
Look at past 'good' days and use the conditions from that day to predict future 'good' days (supervised machine learning).
